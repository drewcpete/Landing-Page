            <h3>Vacation Site</h3>
            <p>My pair and I worked on a website for a fictional vacaction company.  We offered various cheap tours in California, Oregon and India. <span>Here are some of the languages and technologies used:</span></p>

              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS</li>

          <h3>Resort</h3>
          <p>This website is for a fictional resort!  It was made on the our second day and its not very good.  It was one of the first projects that we used css styling on. <span>Here are some of the languages and technologies used:</span></p>

          <h3>Bad-Toes Pig Rescue</h3>
          <p>I had the most fun making this webpage.  It incorporates divs, spans and floats.  These are very powerful tools and are all seemingly used very frequently. <span>Here are some of the languages and technologies used:</span></p>

            <li>HTML</li>

          <p>We took one of my original projects and added some more functionality to it.  Most noteably, we linked other pages to our site. <span>Here are some of the languages and technologies used:</span></p>

        <div class="about">

          <p>Hi! My name is &rew Peterson and I'm learning how to program at Epicodus! For the past 9 year I've been working for Shannon & Wilson, a geotechnical engineering company, as a field and lab tecnhnician. While I primarily did construction materials quality assurance, my responsibilities also included construction observation, environmental sample collection, and lab management.  I ran my own soils lab and was the lead construction materials tecnhnician on a $400mil <a href="https://www.alaskarailroad.com/sites/default/files/Communications/2016%20Port%20MacKenzie%20Rail%20Extension.pdf">remote rail extension</a> outside of Wasilla, AK. In 2018 and 2019, I put a lab together and performed soils testing for approximately 7 months on the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/welcome-most-toxic-place-america-n689141">Hanford Nuclear Site</a> outside of Richland, WA. Other projects included large scale gold mines, <a href="https://www.gvea.com/energy/evacreek">wind farms</a>, remote village runways, water treatment facilites and large stormwater runoff facilites.  I began working for the company in Fairbanks, AK and was also full-time employee at offices in Anchorage, AK and Denver, CO.  I've also worked on projects for the company's offices in Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, and Pasco.  I had been looking for a reason and a way to move back to Portland and change careers, and after my fathers health took a turn for the worse, I quit my job, packed up a U-Haul and returned to my homeland of Portland and enrolled at epicodus.</p>
