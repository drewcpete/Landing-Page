            <h3>Resort</h3>
            <p>This website is for a fictional resort!  It was made on the our second day and its not very good.  It was one of the first projects that we used css styling on. <span>Here are some of the languages and technologies used:</span></p>

            <h3>Education and Early Work History</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is &rew Peterson and I'm learning how to program at Epicodus! I attended Lakeridge High School in Lake Oswego, OR and graduated in 2006.  After high school, I worked at a restaurant for about a year before the business dissolved.  After that I got a sales job selling ergonomic furniture at a store called Relax the Back.  We sold the nicest office furniture, beds, recliners and massage chairs on the market.  I worked at Relax the Back from approximately 2007 to 2012. Tempur-Pedic awarded me with the highest honor they have, "Dream Team Salesman".  The company sent out secret shoppers around the nation, and only two people recieved perfect scores; me and a gentlemen in El Paso, TX.  While working at Relax the Back, I was enrolled at Portland Community College taking primarily botany and horticulture classes. After two years of part time school, I moved to Alaska and began working in construction related services.</p>

            <h3>Recent Work History</h3>
            <p>In 2011, I moved to Fairbanks, AK and began working for Shannon & Wilson, a geotechnical engineering company, as a field and lab tecnhnician. While I primarily did construction materials quality assurance, my responsibilities also included construction observation, environmental sample collection, and lab management.  I ran my own soils lab and was the lead construction materials tecnhnician on a $400mil <a href="https://www.alaskarailroad.com/sites/default/files/Communications/2016%20Port%20MacKenzie%20Rail%20Extension.pdf">remote rail extension</a> outside of Wasilla, AK. In 2018 and 2019, I put a lab together and performed soils testing for approximately 7 months on the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/welcome-most-toxic-place-america-n689141">Hanford Nuclear Site</a> outside of Richland, WA. Other projects included large scale gold mines, <a href="https://www.gvea.com/energy/evacreek">wind farms</a>, remote village runways, water treatment facilites and large stormwater runoff facilites.  I began working for the company in Fairbanks, AK and was also full-time employee at offices in Anchorage, AK and Denver, CO.  I worked on projects for the company's offices in Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, and Pasco.  I had been looking for a reason and a way to move back to Portland and change careers, and after my fathers health took a turn for the worse, I quit my job, packed up a U-Haul and returned to my homeland of Portland and enrolled at epicodus.</p>

                <p class="special">For the last two years I have planned and hosted a rafting trip.  This year, 9 of us floated down the Rogue River for 5 days, 4 nights.  I had friends from Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and New york all attend.  Last year, 15 of us floated down the Deschutes River.  Next year I'm hoping we can get a permit to do the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. </p>
